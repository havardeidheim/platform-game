Camera Behavior (Original Flash/AS3 Game)
==========================================

All camera logic is in Game.as, specifically the centerStage() method.


X-axis (horizontal)
--------------------
The player is always centered. Every frame, all objects are shifted so the
player sits at stageWidth / 2.


Y-axis (vertical)
-----------------
Uses a dead zone system with three behaviors:

  Upper bound:  Above stageHeight/3 + 50px
                Camera scrolls down to keep player at that line.

  Dead zone:    Between stageHeight/3 + 50px and stageHeight * 2/3
                No camera movement — player moves freely.

  Lower bound:  Below stageHeight * 2/3
                Camera scrolls up to keep player at that line.

There is also a special case: on first spawn or respawn, the player is
centered vertically at stageHeight / 2 (middle of screen).


Key code from centerStage()
---------------------------

  // X: always centered
  changex = (stage.stageWidth / 2) - player.x;
  player.x = stage.stageWidth / 2;

  // Y: dead zone between 1/3 and 2/3 of screen
  if (firstspawn || respawn) {
      changey = (stage.stageHeight / 2) - player.y;
      player.y = stage.stageHeight / 2;
  }
  else if (player.y > (stage.stageHeight / 3) * 2) {
      changey = ((stage.stageHeight / 3) * 2) - player.y;
      player.y = ((stage.stageHeight / 3) * 2);
  }
  else if (player.y < (stage.stageHeight / 3) * 1 + 50) {
      changey = ((stage.stageHeight / 3) * 1) + 50 - player.y;
      player.y = ((stage.stageHeight / 3) * 1) + 50;
  }

The deltas (changex, changey) are then applied to all game objects in both
dimensions via objt.move(changex, changey), which shifts their x, y, startX,
and startY.


Summary
-------
The camera is not a simple center-follow. It is horizontally locked to center
but vertically uses a dead zone spanning the middle third of the screen (with
a 50px offset on the upper bound). This gives the player vertical breathing
room while always keeping horizontal awareness centered.
