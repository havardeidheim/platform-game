Missing Features (present in the original Flash game)
=====================================================

1. No save/progress system
   The original Flash game tracked level completion, best times, and star ratings
   per level using SharedObject (Flash's localStorage equivalent). The TypeScript
   port has none of this. Completing a level has no persistent effect.

2. No star/scoring system
   The original Archivements.as had per-level star ratings (0-4 stars) based on
   completion time thresholds. This gave levels replay value and a sense of mastery.

3. No pause functionality
   The original had pauseGame()/unpauseGame() methods and handled window focus
   changes (pausing when the tab loses focus, reducing framerate to 10fps). The
   current port just keeps running in the background.

4. Missing one-directional platforms
   The original had DownPlatform, UpPlatform, LeftPlatform, RightPlatform —
   platforms you can pass through from one side but land on from the other (think
   Mario semi-solid platforms). These aren't ported.


Quality of Life Improvements
============================

5. No death/respawn feedback
   When you die, the player instantly teleports to the last checkpoint with no
   visual indication of what happened. A brief flash, screen shake, or particle
   burst would communicate "you died" clearly.

6. No level completion feedback
   Reaching the goal just ends. There's no completion screen, no time display,
   no "next level" prompt.

7. No window focus handling
   If you tab away, the game continues running. The accumulated time delta can
   cause physics glitches when you return.

8. Level select has no completion state
   All 10 levels look identical in the level select. There's no indication of
   which levels you've beaten or how well you did.

9. No timer/frame counter visible during gameplay
   The original tracked frames for scoring. Showing an in-game timer would give
   speedrunners feedback and tie into the star rating system.

10. Fixed canvas size (1280x720)
    No responsiveness to window size. On larger monitors it's small; on smaller
    screens it may overflow.

11. Hardcoded WASD controls
    No key rebinding. Arrow keys aren't supported as an alternative.

12. No "restart level" option
    You can respawn at checkpoint (R), but there's no quick way to restart the
    entire level from scratch (useful for time-attack attempts).

13. Falling blocks don't communicate their timer
    FallingBlock waits 500ms then falls, but there's no visual countdown or shake
    to telegraph the behavior to the player.

14. No level transition
    Finishing a level dumps you back to level select. There's no "continue to
    next level" flow.
